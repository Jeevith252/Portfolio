<b>
        I am a motivated Data Science Engineering student with a strong interest in data analytics, Python programming, and emerging technologies such as machine learning and computer vision. I enjoy learning new tools and applying my knowledge through practical projects and innovation-driven problem solving. I am particularly passionate about building real-world solutions using AI, embedded systems, and software development.

I have worked on multiple technical projects including a fatigue monitoring system (AlertDrive), an eye-gaze-based mouse control system using Jetson Nano, a voice-based educational assistant, and a PDF-to-audio conversion system developed during the NVIDIA Innovation Challenge, where I secured 2nd place. I also have experience in front-end development and basic data science libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

Beyond academics, I actively participate in hackathons, technical workshops, and competitive programming to continuously improve my technical and analytical skills. My goal is to grow into a skilled data science and AI professional who can contribute to impactful, real-world technology solutions.
